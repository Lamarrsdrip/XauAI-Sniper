  - Cloud ML pattern store (save/load per PIN)
  - GPT-5.2 entry analysis + Claude 4.5 Sonnet active position manager via Emergent Universal Key
- **Feb 2026 - EA v4.0 compile fixes & backend parser hardening**
  - Removed dependency on `CDealInfo` class; switched to native `HistoryDealSelect` + `HistoryDealGet*` API (was causing compile error + stale deal data)
  - Tightened Claude close parser (requires `"CLOSE"` with quotes) to prevent false closes from reason text
  - Backend AI endpoints now strip markdown code fences before `json.loads` (Claude often wraps in ```json…```)
  - Verified `/api/download/ea` serves full 1126-line EA; all EA→backend endpoints (ai/analyze, ai/manage-position, news/check, ml/patterns/save, ml/patterns/load, journal/log, journal/weekly-report) respond correctly

- **Feb 2026 - v4.2 Smart Features (zero-cost intelligence layer)**
  - **Re-entry engine** (pure MQL5, $0 AI cost): after a loser, watches for up to 15 min — if price reverses >=1.2× SL past original entry in the original direction → auto re-enter at 0.5× size. Solves the "stopped out then market reversed" pain point.
  - **DXY correlation gate**: every 15 min the EA fetches `/api/smart/dxy`. If DXY says gold is bullish but we're trying to SELL, veto the trade. Huge on gold where ~75% of big moves follow inverse DXY.
  - **Drawdown recovery mode**: 3+ losses in a day → risk auto-capped at 0.5% until balance recovers. Auto-disables after a win. Prevents revenge-blowup spiral.
  - **Streak cool-down**: 3 losses in 45 min → pause trading entirely for 20 min. Breaks the tilt cycle.
  - **Better close tracking**: now walks position history to recover the true entry price (not just the close price) for accurate re-entry threshold math.
  - Dashboard shows DXY bias, drawdown state, streak pause timer, re-entry watcher status.
  - All 8 new features fully tunable via MT5 inputs, still respect `InpBacktestMode` (strategy-tester-safe).

- **Feb 2026 - v4.2.1 Local ML reunified with signature system**
  - `TradePattern` struct now stores the 7-field signature alongside fuzzy fields.
  - `GetMLScore()` rewritten to use the SAME hierarchical rollup as the hive (exact → drop_mom → drop_stoch → drop_rsi → drop_session). Local ML no longer orphaned.
  - Veto threshold raised to `n >= 10` for local stability.
  - Pattern file format bumped to v2 with magic header `0xA15E2`. Old v1 files are detected and discarded cleanly (no crash).
  - Cloud-save JSON now includes `sig` field so patterns round-trip correctly when loaded on another machine.
